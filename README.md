## Unit tests

Unit tests are implemented using vitest. All tests are placed in the \tests\ folder.

```bash
# To run the unit test:
npm run unittests

# or, without the script
npx vitest ./tests/
```

## End-to-end tests

End-to-end testing is implemented with playwright. It requires your app running in different browsers.

```bash
# To run the end-to-end test:
npm run e2etests

# or, without the script
npx playwright test
```

## Adjustung

Use the ``playwright.config.js`` or ``vite.config.js`` to adjust the testing libraries to your needs.

Happy coding!
